# HTML Learning Repository

## 📘 About This Repository

This repository is a part of my journey to learn web development, starting with the basics of **HTML (HyperText Markup Language)**. It contains my notes, practice files, and small projects that I work on while exploring different HTML concepts.

## 🌐 Why I’m Learning HTML

HTML is the foundation of every website. Learning HTML is the first essential step toward becoming a web developer. It helps in understanding how websites are structured and how content is displayed in the browser. This repository reflects my first steps in web development and documents my learning progress.

## 📂 What This Repository Includes

- Basic HTML pages created as part of practice exercises  
- Experiments with different HTML tags and attributes  
- Simple web page layouts  
- Notes and explanations for reference and revision

## 🧠 Topics I’ve Covered So Far

- Structure of an HTML document (`<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`)
- Headings and paragraphs
- Text formatting and inline elements
- Lists: unordered, ordered, and nested lists
- Links and navigation using `<a>` tags
- Images using `<img>` tag
- Tables and basic layout structure
- Forms and form elements (input, button, labels, etc.)
- Introduction to semantic HTML elements

## 🎯 My Learning Goals

- Develop a strong understanding of HTML  
- Build simple, clean, and well-structured web pages  
- Get ready to learn CSS for styling  
- Start working on small web projects  
- Create a basic personal portfolio website

## 🛠 How I’m Learning

I’m using a combination of:

- Online tutorials and video courses  
- MDN Web Docs (Mozilla Developer Network)  
- Hands-on practice through coding small pages  
- Applying new concepts immediately to reinforce learning

## 🚀 What’s Next?

As I become comfortable with HTML, I’ll move on to learning **CSS** to style the pages and **JavaScript** to add interactivity. Eventually, I plan to build complete front-end projects and start exploring frameworks and advanced web development concepts.
